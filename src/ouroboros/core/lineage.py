"""Ontology lineage tracking for evolutionary loops.

Tracks the evolution of ontology across generations: O₁ → O₂ → O₃ → ... → Oₙ.
Each generation's Seed remains frozen (immutable), but the lineage records how
ontology evolves from one generation to the next.

All models are frozen (immutable). State transitions produce new instances via
with_*() methods. OntologyLineage is a read model projected from events -- never
persisted directly, always reconstructed via LineageProjector.
